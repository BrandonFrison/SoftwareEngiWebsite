Most of the links are not working 
I will make the submission form. but i thought that once its made the linking to the databse will be cumbersome.
i havent added much intro thing mostly its just designing
i used around 4 softwares . so if some one it not able to get that whats going on in the code dont worry, i dont know as well 
i used Boot strap, mobirise, dreamweaver and codelobster 

alot work is still remaining
hope it all goes well
